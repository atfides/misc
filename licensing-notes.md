Free & Open Sourced Logos
At Fairpixels, we had unused logo designs piling up on our hard drives and decided to make them available to the world, for free. The logos below can be downloaded unlimited times and used by anyone. For personal & commercial projects. No attribution required. Perfect for mvp's and mockups.
